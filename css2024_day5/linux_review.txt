## Logical and (&&)
#----- excute multiple Bash commands at once
E.g.
mkdir my_new_project && cd my_new_project && nano myscript.sh
(make_directory - change directory - create script and edit)

# View scripts with name "name"
ls -al | grep "script"

E.g.
cat myscript.sh | grep "I can do this" && echo -e "The phrase 'I can do this' has been found successfully"
